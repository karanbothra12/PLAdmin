<p><strong>What is Personal Information?</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, personal information is any information about an identified or identifiable individual. Personal information does not include anonymous or non-personal information (i.e., information that cannot be associated with or tracked back to a specific individual).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automatic collecting and storing of data for technical reasons, certain data is always passed on to us from your computer as the communication takes place on the internet. This includes the date and time you visited our website, your browser type, the browser settings, the operating system, the previous website you visited and the quantity of data transmitted.</p>
<p>This information will only be stored to use in the case of an error and will be deleted after 30 days. This information is usually not personal data. Furthermore, your computer also transfers your IP-Address to us, which in individual cases could be personal-related. The above-mentioned data is only used for internal system-related purposes.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>
<p>We collect and maintain different types of personal information in respect of those individuals who seek to be, are, or were employed by us. This includes personal information contained in:</p>
<ul>
<li>resumes and/or applications;</li>
<li>references and interview notes;</li>
<li>photographs and video;</li>
<li>letters of offer and acceptance of employment;</li>
<li>mandatory policy acknowledgement sign-off sheets;</li>
<li>payroll information; including but not limited to social insurance number, pay cheque deposit information, and GRRSP/ESP information;</li>
<li>wage and benefit information;</li>

<li>background screening information;</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the examples listed above, personal information also includes information such as name, home address, telephone, personal email address, date of birth, employee identification number and marital status, and any other information necessary to P L International's business purposes, which is voluntarily disclosed in the course of an employee's application for employment with P L International.&nbsp;Personal information collected for employment purposes is considered &ldquo;employment data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the context of the registration, it is necessary that you provide various personal data, which we will store and use. While doing so, we only require you to provide such information in order for you to be able to take advantage of your app.</p>
<p>In the registration process we collect and use your email address or similar registration ID and possibly ask you to choose and create a password. Additionally, you can also provide us with your name and company handle. We may offer more registration alternatives in the future, which will ask different, clearly labeled information (such as using your mobile number instead of your e-mail address). We use the above-named data to authenticate you as the legitimate user of your app. We use the email address only once for verification, other than that it is only used for login purposes. We store passwords only on the user&rsquo;s device for ease of use, passwords are encrypted and stored on the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, we (automatically) store certain activities during your use of the app. This includes the user-ID, your login date and time, your browser type, the browser settings and the operating system. Unless you give us permission to continue to store and use your data, we delete the above-mentioned information as soon as you delete or deactivate your user account.<br /> &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a general rule, P L International collects personal information directly from you. In most circumstances where the personal information that we collect about you is held by a third party, we will obtain your permission before we seek out this information from such sources (such permission may be given directly by you, or implied from your actions). &nbsp;Note that all data you save will be visible to your Admin/ Manager.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may utilize the services of third parties (including other members of the P L International Family) in our business and may also receive personal information collected by those third parties in the course of the performance of their services for us or otherwise. Where this is the case, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such third parties have represented to us that they have the right to disclose your personal information to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements, we may collect information about you without your knowledge or consent. Note the app does not and cannot infiltrate a user&rsquo;s storage to collect any information stored on the device.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>How Do We Use&nbsp;Personal Information?</strong></p>

<ul>

<p>We may use your personal information without your knowledge or consent where we are permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements to do so. Your data can be used by developers for debugging in case of error or maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>The work output of P L International's employees, whether in paper record, computer files, or in any other storage format belongs to us, and that work output, and the tools used to generate that work output, are always subject to review and monitoring by P L International.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the course of conducting our business, we may monitor employee activities and our premises and property. For example, some of our locations are equipped with surveillance cameras. These cameras are generally in high risk areas or plant sites. Where in use, surveillance cameras are there for the protection of employees and third parties, and to protect against theft, vandalism and damage to P L International's goods and property. Generally, recorded images are routinely destroyed and not shared with third parties unless there is suspicion of a crime, in which case they may be turned over to the police or other appropriate government agency or authority. Pursuant to our Acceptable Use of Computer Systems, Equipment, Infrastructure and Internet Systems Policy, we have the capability to monitor all employees' computer and e-mail use. Note that the camera and storage permissions are required to store receipts only and won&rsquo;t be used for anything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This section is not meant to suggest that all employees will in fact be monitored or their actions subject to constant surveillance. We have no duty to so monitor. It is meant to bring to your attention the fact that such monitoring may occur and may result in the collection of personal information from employees (e.g. through their use of our resources). When using a&nbsp; P L International equipment or resources employees should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to their use of such equipment or resources.</p>
